    <td valign="top" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: dotted"><!--DWLayoutEmptyCell--><p><strong>UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism: Dirty Business (5/17/2019)</strong></p>
<p>In the United States, most of us don&rsquo;t think much about recycling. We rinse our yogurt containers, crush our milk cartons, and break down our boxes. But once our trash hits the curb, we forget about it. If it doesn&rsquo;t wind up in a landfill or floating in the ocean, our recyclable plastic is likely to be exported and broken down overseas.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For decades, China has been the main destination for recyclable plastic. But in the last three years, the Chinese government has increasingly restricted waste imports and nearly half of all American plastic exports have shifted to smaller Southeast Asian countries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to Minh Khai, Vietnam -- where plastic from all over the world finds new life. The multimedia project &ldquo;Dirty Business&rdquo; documents the experiences of residents in Minh Khai as they wrestle with the blessings and curses of an empire built on our trash. It consists of a written narrative, short film, data visualizations, and a portrait series.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Vietnam, Minh Khai is what&rsquo;s referred to as l&agrave;ng ngh&#7873;, a craft or occupational village. The whole town specializes in plastic recycling. Hundreds of family-owned businesses come together to manage every step of the process: from cleaning used plastic bags to melting them down and refashioning them into new plastic products.</span></p>
<p>When we first set out to tell the story of Minh Khai, we knew that we wanted to capture the unique &ldquo;ecology&rdquo; of this place, the interwoven nature of each business, and the human lives that depend on it. We interviewed factory workers&hellip; but also people like Tuan, whose cargo hauling business moves plastic from one stage of recycling to the next; Huan, whose family first brought the recycling industry to Minh Khai during the Vietnam war; and Cam, who (after four decades in business) has gained thirty properties and financial security for her children.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&rsquo;s no denying that the recycling trade has brought economic development to Minh Khai, and allowed families to flourish. Yet it is one of the most polluted places in Vietnam. The drinking water in Minh Khai is what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency refers to as &ldquo;high-strength&rdquo; industrial runoff; it&rsquo;s considered non-potable according to virtually every scale that exists. Carcinogenic smoke in the atmosphere causes allergies and -- residents are now learning -- lung cancer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This juxtaposition is what drove our reporting and the production techniques you see in &ldquo;Dirty Business.&rdquo; The residents of Minh Khai have complicated, and often contradictory, relationships with the industry that both feeds and poisons their community. We employed wider shots to contextualize each character in their broader environment, and intentionally highlighted visual details that show the inextricable nature of work and life in Minh Khai. This is not a place where people simply come to work, then leave at the end of their shift. All is connected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, we wanted to layer the history of the town -- and visual evidence of its rapid industrialization -- over the images you see of Minh Khai&rsquo;s present. We used juxtaposed satellite images, taken decades apart, to reveal Minh Khai&rsquo;s dramatic transition from an agricultural community to the industrial hub it is today.</span></p>
<p>Finally, we sought to demystify the recycling process itself. We used time-lapse images to capture the repetitive, time-consuming nature of this work and followed the complete journey of recyclable waste, from the moment it enters a recycling center in the United States to the moment it emerges as a fresh plastic bag in the factories of Minh Khai.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We placed this transformation in its global context by mapping the flow of Vietnam&rsquo;s plastic imports in recent years and plotted the volume of imports on a variable thickness band chart for comparison. As China continues to restrict plastic waste imports, Minh Khai and places like it have played an increasingly important role in processing waste from other parts of the world.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As consumers, especially in the United States, we&rsquo;re tremendously dependent on plastic products. &ldquo;Dirty Business&rdquo; asks viewers to look beyond the items they recycle and turn their attention to the far-reaching systems in place to deal with our waste.</span></p>
<p>The story centers on the experience of one community of people, but we hope that its narrative brings an intimate and human-centered lens to an issue that impacts us all. The project was published as part of a reporting initiative, titled &ldquo;Unseen,&rdquo; on under-reported labor issues by the University of California-Berkeley&rsquo;s Graduate School of Journalism.</p>
